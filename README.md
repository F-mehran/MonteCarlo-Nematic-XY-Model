2D Liquid Crystal Simulation using the Nematic XY Model

This repository contains a full Monte Carlo simulation of a 2D nematic liquid crystal, based on the Lebwohl–Lasher Hamiltonian, used to model phase transitions in liquid crystals.

# Physics Idea

I study the phase behavior of a 2D nematic system.
Due to the Mermin–Wagner theorem, true long-range order cannot exist in 2D.
Instead, a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) transition occurs, associated with topological defects.

I compute:

Magnetization-like nematic order parameter

Susceptibility χ(T)

Heat Capacity Cv(T)

Spatial correlation function g₂(r)

Autocorrelation of relaxational dynamics

Finite-size scaling of critical temperature
